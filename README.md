# ai-git-cli

**ai-git-cli** is an AI-powered command-line tool that supercharges your Git workflow. It provides AI-generated commit messages, codebase analysis, natural language Git commands, and seamless GitHub integrationâ€”all from your terminal. It also supports all standard Git commands, acting as a drop-in replacement for `git`.

---

## Features

- **AI-powered commit messages:** Generate concise, meaningful commit messages using Gemini (and easily extensible to other LLMs).
- **Natural language Git:** Describe what you want to do, and let AI translate it into the right Git command.
- **Codebase analysis:** Analyze your repository with LangGraph-compatible tools (future extensibility).
- **GitHub integration:** Create issues and pull requests directly from the CLI, with optional AI-generated PR titles/descriptions.
- **Full Git support:** Use any standard Git command via `ai-git <command>`.
- **Easy to use:** Drop-in replacement for the `git` command.

```
